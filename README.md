## Overview
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. Huh! Here we take on the challenge! As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted.

## Data
Dataset-(https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh)
This Project is used to predict the flight prices. We will use Flight Price Dataset provided by Kaggle Flight Price. This dataset consists of 10683 records with 13 columns that explain about the flight in India by some Indian and foreign Airlines in 2019.
